Before querying data, make sure to [configure the API key in your environment](/essentials/getting-started#getting-started).

You can query a graph by using the `query` method.

```python
  from circlemind import Circlemind

  # Initialize the client
  client = Circlemind()

  # Query the memories
  res = client.query(
    query="Where does Sophie like to hike?,
    graph_id="customer-id-123"
  )

  print(res)
```

The `graph_id` is an optional parameter. If not set, it defaults to the `default` graph.

The `res` response will be a natural language response to your query.
